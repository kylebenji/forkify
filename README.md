### TODO

    - reset upload page so you can upload more than one recipe before reloading page

### Features and Improvements

    - Display number of pages
    - ability to sort results by duration or number of ingredients (not directly available through API, not very feasible)
    - perform ingredient validation directly in the modal window
    - improve recipe ingredient input by seperating fields and adding more
    - Shopping List so the user can see all the ingredients they want to buy
    - weekly meal planning feature, assign recipes to the next few days and mark them on the calender
    - nutrition data on each ingredient via an APi (spoonacular) and calculate total nutrition data
